You must complete the <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/">workshop request/notification form</a>, the workshop website must include the venue, and at least one Instructor must be identified. If the Instructors change, we will get notified and will be able to make the update.<h3 id="if-i-am-teaching-a-data-carpentry-genomics-workshop-how-many-aws-instances-will-be-provided-and-when-will-we-receive-them">If I am teaching a Data Carpentry Genomics workshop, how many AWS Instances will be provided and when will we receive them?</h3><p>A member of the Workshop Administration Team will contact the Hosts/Instructors approximately 2-3 weeks prior to the workshop to find out how many instances are needed. You will be asked to provide the total number of Instructors, helpers and learners. Approximately 1 week prior to the workshop, the Workshop Administration Team will provide you with test instances for each Instructor and helper for testing/practice. Approximately 3 days before the workshop, you will be asked for your final attendance so we can send you the AWS instances for the workshop. On the day prior to the workshop, the Workshop Administration Team will provide you with instances for each Instructor, helper and learner for the workshop. We will also send a few extras for backup. The AWS Instances will be terminated the day after the workshop. Please submit your workshop request/notification form at least 21 days in advance.<h3 id="what-is-a-slug-and-how-should-i-use-it-to-name-my-workshop-website">What is a slug? And how should I use it to name my workshop website?</h3><p>A slug is a unique identifier used by The Carpentries to connect a workshop with an organisation. Each workshop will have its own slug. The slug should use the following format YEAR-MM-DD-SITE-(online).<ul><li>YEAR being replaced by the four-digit year (e.g. <em>2020</em>)<li>MM being replaced by the two-digit month (e.g. <em>03</em>)<li>DD being replaced by the two digits representing the first day of the workshop (e.g. <em>23</em>)<li>SITE being replaced by the organisation or location name (e.g. <em>stanford</em>)<li>If the workshop will take place online, please add online (e.g. <em>online</em>)</ul><p>This slug format is a part of a validation check in our system, including the dashes separating these variables.<h3 id="should-the-instructor-or-a-member-of-the-host-institution-be-listed-as-the-contact-person-on-the-workshop-webpage-">Should the Instructor or a member of the host institution be listed as the contact person on the workshop webpage ?</h3><p>The contact person for the workshop webpage can be designated by the workshop organiser. The person listed should be able to answer questions regarding the workshop, such as attendance policy, waitlist, location, installation, etc. You can have multiple persons listed as the contact person if needed.<h3 id="where-do-i-find-the-prepost-survey-for-the-learners-to-use">Where do I find the pre/post survey for the learners to use?</h3><p>The learner facing survey links are automatically generated on the workshop’s webpage. Generally, they will be located directly above and within the schedule. You are welcome to share the survey links (located on the workshop webpage) with your attendees whenever the time is right for your workshop.<h3 id="how-do-i-access-the-survey-results">How do I access the survey results?</h3><p>If you are planning a workshop, please notify the Workshop Administration Team of your planned workshop using the <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/">workshop request form</a>. The Workshop Administration Team will send the link to view results of the survey 1-2 weeks prior to the workshop. If there are more than 10 survey responses, you will have the option to download the survey data, using the “Download CSV” link at the bottom right of the survey results page.<h2 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h2><h3 id="if-i-am-only-teaching-portions-of-the-carpentries-curriculum-do-i-still-need-to-register-my-workshop">If I am only teaching portions of the Carpentries curriculum, do I still need to register my workshop?</h3><p>It is important that we know about workshops being publicised because people often contact us to report that they will be unable to attend a workshop or to ask questions and if we do not know about planned workshops we can not provide support or share information with Instructors.<p>If you are teaching a portion of The Carpentries curriculum or if the workshop does not align with the <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core">Core Curriculum</a> we ask that you still <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/">register</a> your workshop and select the “Mix &amp; Match” option for the question “Which Carpentries workshop are you teaching?”. <em>This option is only available for Self-Organised workshops. Centrally-organised workshops are required to follow the Core Curricula.</em><h3 id="when-we-teach-our-workshops-how-closely-do-we-have-to-stick-to-the-carpentries-lesson-plans">When we teach our workshops, how closely do we have to stick to the Carpentries lesson plans?</h3><p>To be considered an official Carpentries workshop, you must follow the <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core">Core Curricula</a>. If you teach something other than what is listed on our webpage we ask that you acknowledge that your workshop is “inspired by SWC/DC/LC” or “based on SWC/DC/LC”. You can still <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/">register</a> your workshop and select the workshop you are teaching is “Mix &amp; Match”, so that we can show others how you use The Carpentries resources.<h2 id="centrally-organised-workshops">Centrally Organised Workshops</h2><h3 id="how-much-does-a-workshop-cost">How much does a workshop cost?</h3><p>If you are a government or non-profit institution and would like The Carpentries to assist with organising your workshop, there is an administrative fee of $2500 US. You will also be responsible for the travel expenses for each Instructor (see below). If you are a for-profit institution please <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">contact us</a>. 50% of workshop coordination fees for for-profit institutions support workshops in diverse communities.<p>Please visit our <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-cost">website</a> for more information.<h3 id="do-instructors-pay-for-travel">Do Instructors pay for travel?</h3><p>Our Instructors are volunteers and are not paid for their time teaching. Therefore we ask the host to cover travel and accommodation costs for Instructors assigned to teach at your institution. We work to find local Instructors but suggest that you estimate about $2000 total ($1000 per Instructor) for the travel, food, and accommodation of the Instructors. <strong>Note travel and accommodation costs might vary globally.</strong><p>The details of how you will manage the Instructors’ travel is discussed once the Instructors are confirmed and introduced to the host. <em>The Carpentries is not involved in this process.</em><h3 id="who-can-be-a-helper-and-what-do-they-contribute-to-the-workshop">Who can be a Helper and what do they contribute to the workshop?</h3><p>Helpers are often recruited from the local community at the host site to support Carpentries workshops. Helpers support learners one-on-one if they are stuck installing software, understanding a certain line of code, or any other parts of the learning process. <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#helper-checklist">Here</a> is more information regarding helpers.<h3 id="are-helpers-reimbursed-for-travel">Are Helpers reimbursed for travel?</h3><p>The Carpentries is not responsible for selecting Helpers. This is the responsibility of the host organisation. It is the discretion of the organisation if they would like to reimburse the helpers for travel. <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#helper-checklist">Here</a> is more information regarding helpers.<h3 id="as-an-instructor-will-i-still-get-credit-for-a-workshop-if-the-host-cancelled">As an Instructor, will I still get credit for a workshop if the host cancelled?</h3><p>If you are scheduled to teach a Carpentries workshop and the host cancels, you will still receive credit for the workshop. If a workshop is scheduled and you have to resign from teaching, you will not receive credit for the workshop.<h3 id="how-soon-can-i-request-a-carpentries-workshop">How soon can I request a Carpentries workshop?</h3><p>The Carpentries workshops are offered on-demand, not on a set schedule. We ask for a minimum of 2-3 months lead time to organise the workshop. If a request is less than 2 months, there will be no guarantee that we will be able to provide Instructors for your workshop.<h3 id="my-currency-is-not-usd-will-i-get-invoiced-in-usd-or-my-local-currency">My currency is not USD, will I get invoiced in USD or my local currency?</h3><p>If your organization does not accept invoices in USD, please let us know. The Workshop Administration Team will connect you with the Business Team, who will work with you in coordinating invoicing. To keep workshops accessible, The Carpentries will take responsibility for standard fees that arise due to an organisation’s location outside of the US. We see this as a good business practice within a global community.<h2 id="self-organised-workshops">Self Organised Workshops</h2><h3 id="is-there-a-fee-for-running-a-self-organised-workshop">Is there a fee for running a Self-Organised workshop?</h3><p>Self-organised workshops are managed by the instructor/organiser.

If you have not taught three Carpentries workshops you are encouraged to be a Supporting Instructor (see below). All Instructors should be familiar with the <a href="https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/">Recommendation for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online</a>.<h3 id="what-is-a-supporting-instructor">What is a Supporting Instructor?</h3><p>The Supporting Instructor role is intended for Instructors with less practice teaching Carpentries curricula to offer experience with online workshops. It also ensures that the instructional team consists of several Carpentries-trained participants. The Supporting Instructor role will be assigned to certified Carpentries Instructors who have taught less than three workshops.<h3 id="when-can-a-supporting-instructor-become-an-experienced-instructor">When can a Supporting Instructor become an Experienced Instructor?</h3><p>Ater being a Supporting Instructor for three Carpentries workshops you will be able to take the role of Experienced Instructor in any Carpentries online workshop.

It is up to the Host to decide if they will charge each participant. Often a nominal fee of $20 reduces the number of no-shows. Since most workshops have a wait list, it is best to be able to offer these spots to people on the wait list instead of having an empty seat.<h3 id="can-i-pay-instructors-a-stipend">Can I pay Instructors a stipend?</h3><p>The Instructors selected to teach workshops are volunteers and are not paid for their service.
