From 2012 through March 2018, 58 Trainers badged 1,480 Instructors. Carpentry Instructors taught 1,332 workshops, reaching more than 37,000 learners in 44 countries. The report also highlights our significant geographic expansion, such as the growth of an active community of Instructors and Trainers in eight African countries.<li><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1404428">August 2018</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1404428"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1404428.svg" alt="DOI" /></a> In this report we revisited and updated some of the workshop related data from the earlier report. We also analysed applications for instructor training received since we opened up our application process in July 2016. Our goal here was to compare the applicant pool with the badged instructor pool and to examine and map application and completion rates across certain characteristics such as country, occupation, areas of expertise, and previous experience and involvement with The Carpentries. Only those applications that came through an open application process (that is, people unaffiliated with existing member organisations) were analysed. Since The Carpentries does not control instructor trainee selection at member sites, including these applications might have skewed our analysis.<li><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2325620">October 2018</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2325620"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2325620.svg" alt="DOI" /></a> In this report, we provide an overview of global workshop activity, including the number of workshops and learners involved globally. We also look at instructor training applications to better understand the backgrounds of people applying to our instructor training program. Additionally we review the growth of our Instructor Trainer community globally.</ul><h4 id="other-assessment-related-publications">Other Assessment-Related Publications</h4><p><em>December, 2017</em><p><a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html">When Do Workshops Work?

Our data suggest that we are having a positive impact, and we expect that other short-format programs can be similarly effective. <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html">Read our full response</a>.</blockquote><p><em>February, 2018</em><p><a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/tractenberg-summary.html">Webinar with Rochelle Tractenberg: Debrief</a><blockquote><p>On February 2, the <a href="https://carpentries.org/assessment-network/">Assessment Network</a> held a webinar with Rochelle Tractenberg. Dr. Tractenberg directs the Collaborative for Research on Outcomes and Metrics at Georgetown University, where she is a tenured professor in the Department of Neurology. Our starting point was the controversy about short-format training which arose last year, following the publication of a 2017 <em>PNAS</em> paper titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604013/">“Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences”</a>. The Carpentries design and deliver short-format training for working with software and data; trainees are researchers from various fields. The Carpentries’ <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html">initial response</a> to the paper discussed many ways in which we have been successful with respect to our goals for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops. However, given that short-format training is a known challenge for generating sustainable content learning, we hoped that Dr. Tractenberg’s expertise might shed some light on areas with room for improvement. <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/tractenberg-summary.html">See the full webinar</a>.</blockquote></article></div></div><div id="up-to-top" class="row"><div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a></div></div><footer id="footer-content" class="bg-grau"><div id="footer"><div class="row"><div class="medium-6 large-5 columns"><h5 class="shadow-black">About HPC Carpentry</h5><p class="shadow-black"> HPC Carpentry is a set of teaching materials designed to help new users take advantage of high-performance computing systems.
